//GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

//WHEN I search for a city I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

//WHEN I view current city weather, I see the city name, the date, an icon representing weather conditions; the temp, humidity, and wind speed.

//WHEN I view the future forecast, I see a 5-day forecast with dates, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

//WHEN I click on a city in the search history I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
